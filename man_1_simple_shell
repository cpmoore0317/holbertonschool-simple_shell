.SH NAME
BBASH \- A simple version of the Linux Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B Command
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.RI [ ARGUMENTS ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

This simple shell replicates a number of features from the Linux Shell. It takes in input, parses the input into tokens, checks the PATH to find a command location, then executes the command. This shell can handle ls, cp, pwd, mv, rm, env, and exit. By the end of this project, some features were left unimplemented due to time constraints. Some exit statuses don't return correctly, and the program fails if the PATH environmental variable is removed or replaced. Finally, this shell supports both interactive and non-interactive modes.

.SH FORMAT
The following are examples of commands with options that alter/display files and directories.
.TP

.B ls -la var/

.TP

.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments are files/directories that are manipulated or printed by commands.

.SH RETURN VALUE
BBASH returns EXIT_SUCCESS if run successfully, and an error code when it fails.
